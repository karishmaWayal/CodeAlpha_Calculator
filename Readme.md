🖥️ Preview

The calculator includes:

A digital display for input and results

Numeric buttons (0–9)

Operator buttons (+, −, ×, ÷)

Functional buttons (C, ⌫, =)

You can deploy this easily using GitHub Pages.

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

⌨️ Keyboard Controls
Key	Action
0–9	Enter numbers
+ - * /	Operators
.	Decimal
Enter	Calculate
Backspace	Delete last input
Esc	Clear display
🧠 How It Works (Brief Explanation)

Button clicks and keyboard events update a string expression

Operators (×, ÷) are converted to JavaScript operators (*, /)

eval() is used to compute the result

Errors are caught and displayed as "Error"

This makes the project great for learning:

DOM selection

Event listeners

String manipulation

Basic error handling

🌱 Possible Improvements

Scientific calculator functions

Mobile vibration feedback

Calculation history

Dark / light mode toggle

Replace eval() with a safer parser
